### Tech used:
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- Express
- Express-Session
- hbs
- CurrencyLayer API

### To do with more time:
- TESTS!!
- Currently, offers work fine if only one used. When both added, money amounts get muddled. It is something to do with the way I've used the if/else statement and should be an easy fix that I can't seem to see right now.
- Currently, money amounts all display to 2 decimal places once currency is selected, however can sometimes be awkwardly long upon landing in basket. Need to find a way to use 'toFixed(2)' all the way through.
- Add users, sign up, sign in
- Add database
- Users can save baskets to profile
- Checkout feature working with suitable API
- Styling
